This is the only way to get some of the secret cats in the game, which are still super rare on top of THAT.</p><p>So it's a lot of waiting for eggs, hatching them, and throwing away tons of cats trying to get the perfect character (This caused other problems but I'll explain that another time XP)</p><p>But, one day when I was trying to get the ultimate cat, something weird happened.</p><p>A white egg showed up on my screen, but there was a message with it. "SPECIAL"</p><p>I was really excited. I've never gotten a special egg before. In fact I'd never even heard of it at all. I sat there for an hour waiting to see what it would turn out to be. Maybe I would be the first one to discover a brand-new cat?</p><p>But what was weird is, the egg never hatched. I started to worry that it was some kind of glitch, so I decided to try and get rid of it before it hurt my computer... and that's where things got REALLY strange.</p><p>No matter what I did, I couldn't move or throw away the egg.</p><p>I tried clicking it over and over, and in the end, all that happened is it made some sort of weird sound.</p><p>This freaked me out so much I deleted the game and reinstalled it. ... but the egg was still there. (Obviously XP)</p><p>Now that I'm older I think what happened is, I had so many mods installed that the egg didn't know what to hatch into? But at the time I thought my computer was haunted or something, or the egg was going to kill me XD</p><p>After a few hours of freaking out, I eventually faced my fears and loaded up the game again. The egg was there, but it didn't seem to be doing anything. So I started raising it like it was a normal pet, brushing it and playing with it and stuff.</p><p>By the end of the day, I actually started thinking it was a cool pet and maybe I could try to figure out how to upload it online as a mod.</p><p>I wasn't able to do that though.</p><p>The next day when I opened the game, the egg was gone, with a message that said it "left home due to happiness."</p><p>Usually the message is "(pet) left home due to sadness" and only happens because you neglected your pet. It's not supposed to happen because you were nice XD</p><p>One last thing!</p><p>The egg actually had a name but I don't remember what it was. It's been driving me crazy ever since. If anyone else has ever seen an egg in their game like this PLEASE <a href='/code/'>sign my guestbook</a>. PLEASE. First one gets 100 cheasy points from me XP</p></div></main></div><script src="/assets/javascripts/reallyplayer.js"></script><script defer src="https://deltarunesite.github.io/beacon.min.js" integrity="sha512-0ahDYl866UMhKuYcW078ScMalXqtFJggm7TmlUtp0UlD4eQk0Ixfnm5ykXKvGJNFjLMoortdseTfsRT8oCfgGA==" data-cf-beacon='{"rayId":"77fade66eea59d84","version":"2022.11.3","r":1,"token":"377f50f2716b474ea394c9bbd3aaef87","si":100}' crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
