XD)</p><p>But one day, one of the spams I got was nothing but random letters and numbers.</p><p>I figured it was probably a failed attempt at sending me a virus, but I thought... what if I tried putting it into Cat Petterz 2 as a mod?</p><p>So I did. And weirdly enough, it actually managed to load.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For people that don't know the game, it has a special visual style. All the pets are made of circles that get animated around. One circle will be the head, another the eyes, another the pupil, another the body etc.</p><p>But I guess the game didn't like the data very much because this pet was only one blue circle. Yeah, just ONE blue circle floating in the air.</p><p>The animations didn't work and it never moved, except for occasionally glitching out.</p><p>All of the stats were really bad and all of my pets really hated it except for... certain ones .... lolâ€¦ I couldn't explain why anyone liked it, but it was really funny to see who did XD</p><p>What's weird is that the circle seemed to be able to multiply. Normally you need 2 pets to fall in love to make a new pet, but after a while, even if the circle was by itself, a "Congrulations!" message would come up, and then there would be 2 circles.</p><p>I thought this was funny, but the circles started piling up. I tried to throw them in the trash, but they were multiplying too fast.</p><p>My screen was nothing but "Congraulations" messages when the game crashed.</p><p>Needless to say I had to wipe all my pets ><</p><p>Lesson learned about using files from weird emails ......... (<a href="/code">Until next time...</a> dun dun DAAA XD)</p></div></main></div><script src="/assets/javascripts/reallyplayer.js"></script><script defer src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js/vaafb692b2aea4879b33c060e79fe94621666317369993" integrity="sha512-0ahDYl866UMhKuYcW078ScMalXqtFJggm7TmlUtp0UlD4eQk0Ixfnm5ykXKvGJNFjLMoortdseTfsRT8oCfgGA==" data-cf-beacon='{"rayId":"77fafeb7989d005c","version":"2022.11.3","r":1,"token":"377f50f2716b474ea394c9bbd3aaef87","si":100}' crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
