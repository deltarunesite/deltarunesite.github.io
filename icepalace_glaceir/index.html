Once you go in it, no matter where you go, you'll always be brought back to the same room.</p><p>Normally one of the characters is supposed to guide you through the maze. But it became one of the most famous (or should I say infamous... XP) parts of the game because if you go there without that character, you'll get basically stuck... FOREVER.</p><p>The developers actually say something about this in the manual… It warns you this glitch is actually "one of the bad guy's magic spells"… Yeah XD... Sorry guys, I think you were just eating a little too much fruitcake when making this part of the game. XP</p><p>As a kid I had no idea that this was a glitch XD I literally spent hours on the screen wandering around thinking there was an exit!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The thing is, there actually is one.</p><p>Somehow kid me was so stubborn, I think I went EVERY single possible direction somehow XD Then the last direction you go is up.</p><p>If you do that, you'll find a door that doesn't appear ANYWHERE else in the game.</p><p>This shocked me so much as a kid I screamed and pulled my controller so hard it unplugged the console XD I actually started crying… but I knew my mom would turn off the game if she heard me, so I held my breath and started hiccuping and gasping. I literally thought I was going to choke on my tears. It only made me cry more that I had to plug the game back in by myself. I was so scared that I would get electrocuted and die from the wires. I was actually always afraid of electrical sockets too because I thought they were looking at me XD (Come on I wasn't a weird kid I promise... XP I got over it after that)</p><p>So I started the game again, and with my hands shaking I went back into the maze.</p><p>But what's super weird, was that somehow, I was able to get RIGHT back to the door.</p><p>I was so happy I almosted started screaming again, but remembered to hold my breath halfway XD Now I was going to be able to see what was in the secret door…</p><p>Or so I thought XP It was locked. And I've never been able to find ANY key in the game that opens it.</p><p>Since then, I can actually get to the door pretty consistently if I concentrate.</p><p>Unfortunately I don't know exactly what I'm doing, and it feels different every time, so I can't give any advice XD</p><p>I know this sounds really really fake but if anyone ever figures out a way to open the door, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE <a href='/code/'>sign my guestbook</a>. I'll even put you in my hall of fame (you know, so there can be someone in it besides me XP)</p><div class="post-footer"><div class="mood"><strong>Mood:</strong><span>Nostalgic</span></div><div class="listening-to"><strong>Listening to:</strong><span>Dragon Blazers - Glaceir</span></div></div></div></main></div><script src="/assets/javascripts/reallyplayer.js"></script><script defer src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js/vaafb692b2aea4879b33c060e79fe94621666317369993" integrity="sha512-0ahDYl866UMhKuYcW078ScMalXqtFJggm7TmlUtp0UlD4eQk0Ixfnm5ykXKvGJNFjLMoortdseTfsRT8oCfgGA==" data-cf-beacon='{"rayId":"77fb0b1548e89d99","version":"2022.11.3","r":1,"token":"377f50f2716b474ea394c9bbd3aaef87","si":100}' crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
