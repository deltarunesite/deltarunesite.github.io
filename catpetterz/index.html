To those that don't know, it's a game where you take care of a cat and raise it. Sounds simple, right? XD</p><p>Actually, the game has a REALLY deep animation and breeding system... So players have been able to hex edit the game data to create brand-new pets.</p><p>If you download the right mods, you can raise birds, hamsters, cars, cartoon characters, and even more. Mewmewqueen's Sympton family pack is a great example of how far things can go.</p><p>However, you have to be careful, because, not all mods are very compatible. When pets fall in love, an egg appears and it hatches into a new pet that combines the animation and visual data of the two parents. Meaning, if you try to breed a hamster and a car, you'll either get a complete freak of nature XD Or, worse, you'll get this message.</p><p>"Incompatible pet"</p><p>Then the game will freeze and the music will glitch out.</p><p>I was so scared of seeing this message as a kid, I would punish my pets so that they would NEVER fall in love. If an egg did appear, I would throw in the trash right away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="/egg">Until one day...</a></p><div class="post-footer"><div class="mood"><strong>Mood:</strong><span>Nostalgic</span></div><div class="listening-to"><strong>Listening to:</strong><span>Cat Petterz 2 OST (Corrupted) - No Cats</span></div></div><div class="comments-footer"><a class="disabled" href="#" title="Comments Disabled">(leave a comment)</a></div></div></main></div><script src="/assets/javascripts/reallyplayer.js"></script><script defer src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js/vaafb692b2aea4879b33c060e79fe94621666317369993" integrity="sha512-0ahDYl866UMhKuYcW078ScMalXqtFJggm7TmlUtp0UlD4eQk0Ixfnm5ykXKvGJNFjLMoortdseTfsRT8oCfgGA==" data-cf-beacon='{"rayId":"77fadb70baad9d46","version":"2022.11.3","r":1,"token":"377f50f2716b474ea394c9bbd3aaef87","si":100}' crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
